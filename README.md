# Sterling

Sterling is Alloy extended to include visualizations generated using the alloy-js library. When an Alloy instance is displayed in the visualizer, a web page containing the alloy-js visualization will automatically be opened.

This project is a simple wrapper around Alloy that contains a basic server to enable communication with the browser and the alloy-js library to enable visualizations in the browser.  The focus of this project is bringing better visualization techniques to Alloy, and so the name Sterling seemed particularly appropriate. After all, sterling silver is an alloy of silver that is generally used to make things that look nice.

## Components and Directory Structure

We make use of the following tools:
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/): Build tool responsible for gathering dependencies and generating the JAR file.
* [Shadow](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow): Gradle plugin used to create a fat JAR.
* [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/): Small webserver framework used to communicate with the browser.
* [Alloy](https://github.com/AlloyTools/org.alloytools.alloy): Currently using Alloy 5.0.0.1

The project is laid out as follows (italicized items are not included in the repository but are generated by building the project):

* _**build/**_
  * _**libs/**_
    * _**Sterling-\*.jar**_ - The Sterling JAR file
* **gradle/** - Gradle wrapper directory ([more info](https://medium.com/@bherbst/understanding-the-gradle-wrapper-a62f35662ab7))
* **libs/** - Directory containing regular Alloy JAR files
* **src/**
  * **main/**
    * **java/** - Sterling source code
    * **resources/**
      * **public/** - Directory containing all web pages and Javascript to display visualizations
* **build.gradle** - The gradle build file that contains dependencies and build instructions
* **gradlew** - The gradle wrapper script ([more info](https://medium.com/@bherbst/understanding-the-gradle-wrapper-a62f35662ab7))
* **gradlew.bat** - The gradle wrapper script for Windows ([more info](https://medium.com/@bherbst/understanding-the-gradle-wrapper-a62f35662ab7))
* **README.md** - This file
* **settings.gradle** - The gradle settings file

## Building

To build the JAR:

```bash
cd /location/of/alloy-vis
./gradlew shadowJar
```

To clean the build directory:
```bash
cd /location/of/alloy-vis
./gradlew clean
```
